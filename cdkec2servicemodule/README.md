# `cdk-ec2-service-module`

Reusable CDK constructs for the assignment-aligned EC2 service model:

* EC2 host
* Dockerized Go application
* host-level Nginx
* encrypted EBS volumes
* SSM-first access posture

The module family plugs into caller-owned infrastructure. Consumers provide an existing VPC and subnet selection, and may optionally provide shared security groups, IAM roles, KMS keys, and EC2 key pairs.

## Current Modules

* `Ec2DockerService`

  * public/default posture
  * module-managed Elastic IP by default
* `PrivateEc2DockerService`

  * private/internal posture
  * no module-managed public endpoint by default

Both variants share:

* service identity and tag resolution
* normalized service outputs
* ingress rules that support CIDRs or source security groups
* operational controls for IAM policy extension, detailed monitoring, and bootstrap hooks

## Consumer CI/CD

This repo publishes the reusable module. A consumer app repo is expected to be a Go application repo and should own:

* Docker image build and push
* environment-specific consumer infra code
* deployment execution

Reference integration material lives in:

* `docs/consumer-cicd.md`
* `.github/workflow-templates/consumer-app-deploy-go-cdk.yml`
* `.github/workflow-templates/consumer-app-deploy-terraform.yml`
* `examples/consumer-proof-stack.ts`

The consumer proof example now validates both postures together:

* a direct public/default service
* a private service behind a caller-managed ALB

For the private path, the ALB forwards to the EC2 host’s Nginx listener. Nginx still proxies to the Dockerized application, preserving the assignment-aligned service shape.

In the current workspace split, the service repo can carry both consumer approaches side by side:

* `infra/terraform/` for the Terraform-module path
* `infra/cdk/` for the Go CDK path that consumes this package

## Local Verification

Use Node 20 for the supported local path.

```bash
nvm use 20
npm ci
npm run verify
```

## Documentation Governance

Tracked docs in this repo are consumer-facing and release-facing.

* use GitHub URLs for cross-repo references
* keep release references aligned to the current line
* keep workflow templates aligned with the actual consumer model

Local operational notes belong under `project_docs/` and stay excluded from git.

## Status

This repo is the active infra/devops evolution path for the original assignment service. The original Terraform/Packer implementation lives separately as the behavioral reference baseline.

Current release line: `0.1.0`
