# cdk-service-host-module

Reusable CDK constructs for the assignment-aligned EC2 service model:

* EC2 host
* Dockerized Go application
* host-level Nginx
* encrypted EBS volumes
* SSM-first access posture

The module family plugs into caller-owned infrastructure. Consumers provide an existing VPC and subnet selection, and may optionally provide shared security groups, IAM roles, KMS keys, and EC2 key pairs.

## Current Modules

* `PublicServiceHost`

  * public/default posture
  * module-managed Elastic IP by default
* `PrivateServiceHost`

  * private/internal posture
  * no module-managed public endpoint by default

Both variants share:

* service identity and tag resolution
* normalized service outputs
* ingress rules that support CIDRs or source security groups
* operational controls for IAM policy extension, detailed monitoring, and bootstrap hooks

## Deployability Contract

* Service repo is `sc-ec2-go-service` under the Bh-an namespace.
* The service repo builds and publishes the Docker image to GHCR:

  * `ghcr.io/bh-an/ec2-go-service:<tag>`
* CDK is the primary consumer path for deployment.
* Terraform is an aligned secondary path maintained in lock-step with the CDK shape.
* This module expects a Docker image reference from GHCR to be provided by the consumer stack.
* Current deployability assumption: the GHCR package is public so the EC2 host can pull it during bootstrap without extra registry credentials.

## Consumer CI/CD

This repo publishes the reusable module. The service repo `https://github.com/Bh-an/sc-ec2-go-service` owns:

* Docker image build and GHCR publishing
* environment-specific consumer infra code
* deployment execution

Reference integration material in this repo:

* `docs/consumer-cicd.md`
* `.github/workflow-templates/consumer-app-deploy-go-cdk.yml`
* `.github/workflow-templates/consumer-app-deploy-terraform.yml`
* `examples/consumer-proof-stack.ts`

The consumer proof example validates both postures together:

* a direct public/default service
* a private service behind a caller-managed ALB

For the private path, the ALB forwards to the EC2 host's Nginx listener. Nginx still proxies to the Dockerized application, preserving the assignment-aligned service shape.

In the current split, the service repo can carry both consumer approaches side by side, with CDK as primary:

* `infra/cdk/` for the Go CDK path that consumes this package (primary)
* `infra/terraform/` for the Terraform-module path (aligned secondary)

## Local Verification

Use Node 22 for the preferred local path. The supported runtime range remains Node 20, 22, and 24.

```bash
nvm use 22
npm ci
npm run verify
```

## Published Paths

* Source (TypeScript): `https://github.com/Bh-an/sc-cdk-service-host-module`
* Go bindings: `github.com/Bh-an/sc-cdk-service-host-module-go/cdkservicehostmodule`
* Service image (owned by service repo): `ghcr.io/bh-an/ec2-go-service:<tag>`

## Status

This repo is the active infra/devops evolution path for the original assignment service. The original Terraform/Packer implementation lives separately as the aligned Terraform repo.

Current release line: `v0.3.0`
